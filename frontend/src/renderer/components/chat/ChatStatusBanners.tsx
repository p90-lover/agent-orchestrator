 * later turn failing for a reason that looks generic. A thread the provider has put
 * into `system_error` looks, from AO's side, like an agent that has gone quiet.
 *
 * Persistent recovery states live above the scroller; the transient MCP note docks
 * below the composer so it does not displace the conversation.
